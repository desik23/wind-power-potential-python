## Overview

In this assignment, we evaluated the maximum potential annual wind energy production available to the state of Iowa. Here we attempt to: 

1. Identify all land suitable for wind turbine placement, subject to the siting constraints enumerated below.
2. For each wind data polyon, calculate the area (i.e., fraction of the polygon) suitable for wind production.
3. Calculate the number of wind turbines that could be placed in each polygon. 
4. Calculate the total annual energy production that would be realized by the maximum possible number of new turbines.

The assumption is that the wind turbines will follow the design specifications of: 
-Vestas V136-3.45 MW turbines (https://us.vestas.com/en-us/products/4-mw-platform/V136-3-45-MW)
-150 m hub height

For Scenario 1 (3 times turbine height from residential), it was determined that there was a maximum of 54,926 turbines possible having a wind potential of 1,020,372 GWh, while Scenario 2 (10 times turbine height from residential) consisted of 50,583 turbines with wind potential of 939,806 GWh.

## Approach

### Data Aquisition

Feature data was extracted from [OpenStreetMap](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features), except for wind data.

We first identified all suitable land for wind turbine placement but utilizing specific siting contraints as show below. 

|min distance to turbine |feature class|
|-----------------------:|:-------------------|
|3 H | residential buildings (Scenario 1)|
|10 H | residential buildings (Scenario 2)|
|3 H | non-residential buildings|
|7500 m | airports|
|0 | military facilities|
|0 | nature reserves, parks, and wetlands|
|1 H | rivers|
|0 | lakes|
|2 H | power lines|
|1 H | power plants|
|5 d | wind turbines|

where:

* H = turbine height (tower base â†” hub of rotor)
* d = rotor diameter
* 0: turbine may be immediately adjacent to, but not on or in, the feature

Following these criteria, we created variables that would easily allow us to substitue the buffer requirements for the different features. 

```H3 = 150 * 3
H10 = 150 * 10
airport = 7500
H2 = 150 * 2
H1 = 150
d = 136
turbine = 5 * d
turbinebuffer = math.pi * ((5 * d)**2) 
```

We then established a connection to the pgAdmin database using 
```pg_uri_template = 'postgresql+psycopg2://{user}:{pwd}@{host}/{db_name}``` 
and utilize the given username, password, host and database information to access the data. 

### Query Example

To identify all land suitable for wind turbine placement, we used the following code to filter though various constraints. The column headings were changed for each criteria, however the general code structure was very similar. 

```buildings_3h = f"""
SELECT
osm_id, building, landuse, aeroway, military, highway, railway,
leisure, planet_osm_polygon.natural, planet_osm_polygon.power, "generator:source", water, waterway,
ST_BUFFER(way, {H3}) as way
FROM
planet_osm_polygon
WHERE
building IN ('yes', 'residential', 'apartments', 'house', 'static_caravan', 'detached')
OR
landuse = 'residential'
OR
place = 'town'
"""
```
Here we select the column names from the data we used using ```SELECT```, then added the buffer variable (H3), then looked in the identified table using ```FROM``` and selected the constraints using ```WHERE```.

### Wind Data and Power Production 

We then merged the subqueries and calculated suitable areas by subtracting these subqueries from wind cells which contained 10km<sup>2</sup> square polygons associated with average annual wind speed (m s<sup>-1</sup>).
    
Finally, we calculated how many wind turbines could be placed in each suitable cell and the energy produced from all the cells for each of the residential exclusion distance scenarios.

## Results 

Scenario 1 (3 times turbine height from residential):
Number of turbines = 54,926
Wind potential =  1,020,372 GWh

Scenario 2 (10 times turbine height from residential):
Number of turbines = 50,583
Wind potential =  939,806  GWh
